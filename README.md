# Hi, I'm Haider

**Data & AI Engineer at Royal Cyber Inc.**

### About Me

I build end-to-end data pipelines and AI solutions that drive real business impact.

My work sits at the intersection of **Data Engineering** and **Artificial Intelligence** — designing scalable lakehouse architectures, developing machine learning models, and deploying LLM-powered applications into production.

---

### What I Do

**Data Engineering**  
Building robust data pipelines on the Databricks Lakehouse Platform using Delta Lake, Unity Catalog, and Apache Spark. Designing medallion architectures that transform raw data into reliable, analytics-ready assets.

**AI & Machine Learning**  
Developing and deploying ML models with MLflow, building RAG-based LLM applications with LangChain, and implementing computer vision solutions with OpenCV and deep learning frameworks.

**MLOps**  
Taking models from notebooks to production — CI/CD pipelines, model versioning, monitoring, and orchestration with tools like Airflow and Databricks Workflows.

### Background

Before diving deep into the data world, I came from **robotics and autonomous systems** — working on SLAM algorithms, drone navigation, and sensor fusion. That background shaped how I approach problems: systems thinking, real-time constraints, and a bias toward solutions that actually ship.

Currently pursuing my **Master's in Mechanical & Materials Engineering** at Western University.
