# Hi there, I'm Haider 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm a Data & AI Engineer at Royal Cyber Inc. with a deep passion for building intelligent data systems and AI solutions that drive real business impact. With a strong foundation in Python, Machine Learning, and Data Engineering, I specialize in crafting end-to-end data pipelines and AI applications on the Databricks Lakehouse Platform. I'm a Databricks enthusiast through and through — from Delta Lake and Unity Catalog to MLflow and Spark, I live and breathe the lakehouse architecture. My expertise spans across data engineering, machine learning, LLM-based applications, and MLOps, with a background in robotics and computer vision that gives me a unique perspective on solving complex problems. I thrive on transforming raw data into actionable insights and deploying AI models that actually make it to production. Let's connect and explore the limitless possibilities at the intersection of data engineering and AI.
