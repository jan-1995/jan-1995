### From Robots to Data Pipelines

I used to teach drones how to navigate and robots how to see. Now I teach data how to flow and models how to think.

My work sits at the intersection of **Data Engineering** and **Artificial Intelligence** — designing scalable lakehouse architectures, developing machine learning models, and deploying LLM-powered applications into production. I build end-to-end solutions that don't just work in notebooks, they ship.

### What I'm Building

**Data Engineering**  
Robust data pipelines on the Databricks Lakehouse Platform using Delta Lake, Unity Catalog, and Apache Spark. Medallion architectures that transform chaos into analytics-ready gold.

**AI & Machine Learning**  
ML models with MLflow, RAG-based LLM applications with LangChain and Azure AI Foundry, and computer vision solutions with OpenCV and deep learning frameworks.

**MLOps**  
The unsexy work that makes AI actually useful — CI/CD pipelines, model versioning, monitoring, and orchestration with Airflow and Databricks Workflows.

### The Backstory

Before data became my thing, I lived in the world of **robotics and autonomous systems** — SLAM algorithms, drone navigation, sensor fusion. Building systems where failure meant hardware hitting the ground taught me to think in terms of reliability, real-time constraints, and solutions that actually survive contact with reality.

Currently wrapping up my **Master's in Mechanical & Materials Engineering** at Western University.
